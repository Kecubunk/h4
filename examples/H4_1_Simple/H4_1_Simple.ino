/*
 *    Demonstrates usage of the H4 timer libarary for common functions
 *    By "common" we mean neither a Lambda function nor a C++ Standard library std::function object
 *    
 *    While H4 can be used to good effect with "common" functions, its flexibility only really becomes
 *    apparent when Lambda functions and std::function objects are used. You are strongly urged to
 *    learn these features of C++ to get the best of out H4
 *    
 *    This example flashes the built-in LED "in the background" continuously  while simulating other  
 *    work in the main loop.
 *    
 *    It also creates a simple function (whose output will be interleaved with the main loop's output)
 *    and also sets up a one-time future randomly timed task to cancel the simple function
 *

  h4.loop must be called as often as possible, all your timings will be "out" if you don't
  do not do anything in loop that causes any long delays or waits for external resources.
  use Async libraries, register a callback and use "runNow" in the callback.
  If you do this, you will NEVER need to call delay() - which is a GOOD THING
